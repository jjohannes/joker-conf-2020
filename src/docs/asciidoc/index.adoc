== Who is Gradle?

Fully remote distributed company

== What is Gradle?

* https://github.com/gradle/gradle[*Gradle Build Tool*]
** Open Source (APL)
** for Java, Groovy, Kotlin, Scala, ...
** Developed by Gradle Inc. with many community contributions

== What is Gradle?

* https://gradle.com[*Gradle Enterprise*]
** Works with multiple Built Tools: Gradle Build Tool, Maven, ...
** Build Insights, Caching, Performance Analysis, Flaky Test Detection, ...

* Public Build Scans for Gradle builds: https://scans.gradle.com/[scans.gradle.com]

== What's special about Gradle Build Tool?

* Can be used to write imperative scripts
** like Ant, but with a proper programming language
* Can be used to _model_ your software
** like Maven, but with a richer and more extensible model
* Many Gradle builds today are a mix of both
** Its strength is its weakness: spaghetti code build scripts are common :(

== Perspective on Gradle in this talk

* Look at Gradle as a tool to model your software
* Let Gradle read that model to build your software

Even if you are new to Gradle, you can and should start this way!

== Summary

* Look at Gradle as a tool to model your software
* Treat each component in your architecture as a separate Gradle build
* Treat build configuration and customization as separate components
